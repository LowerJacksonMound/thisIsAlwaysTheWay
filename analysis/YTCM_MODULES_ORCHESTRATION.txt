Here’s the initial draft of SPEC-001 which outlines the orchestration system tying together all the individual modules you’ve implemented.

Let me know if you’d like to:
	•	Dive deeper into any section (e.g., database, module wrapping)
	•	Add web UI/dashboard support
	•	Replace Prefect with something else like Temporal

Happy to refine this with you.

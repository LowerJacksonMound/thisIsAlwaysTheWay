# Script Assessment

I've analyzed your Python scripts for testability, code quality, and modularity. Here's my assessment:

## Overall Structure

All scripts follow good design patterns:
- Proper Protocol definitions for APIs (good use of typing.Protocol)
- Mock/Real implementation pattern with CLI toggle
- Consistent logging configuration
- Signal handling for graceful shutdown
- Error handling with proper exception reporting
- Modular design with separation of concerns

## Issues Found

1. **String formatting error** in all scripts:
   ```python
   # Current (incorrect)
   logger.info(f'Received signal {{signum}}, shutting down...')
   
   # Should be
   logger.info(f'Received signal {signum}, shutting down...')
   ```
   The double braces escape the braces rather than format the variable.

2. **Incomplete real implementations**:
   While the structure is good, all real implementations contain TODOs and placeholder code. This is clearly marked but means they're not production-ready.

3. **Limited mock implementations**:
   The mocks provide simple hardcoded responses which is sufficient for basic testing but doesn't simulate different scenarios.

## Script-Specific Notes

### youtube_automator.py
- Good structure but lacks actual orchestration logic
- The `run()` method should contain well-defined workflow steps

### frame_prompt_extractor.py
- Properly handles file paths for frame images
- Clear separation between extraction logic and client implementation

### runway_video_generator.py
- Correctly uses asyncio for async API calls
- Handles the prompt parameter properly
- Missing code to save the generated video to a file

### engagement_tracker.py
- Good metrics retrieval structure
- Returns a well-defined dictionary format

## Integration Potential

The scripts can run independently and could work together with:
1. A shared configuration system
2. Output from one script serving as input to another
3. A higher-level orchestrator script

To improve integration:
- Add file output options to each script
- Create consistent JSON schemas for data exchange
- Consider implementing a shared data store or message queue

## Conclusion

These scripts are well-designed for testing with mocked APIs. They follow good software design principles and could function in production with the TODOs implemented. The mocks are sufficient for basic testing but could be enhanced for more comprehensive test scenarios.

With the f-string formatting fixed and real implementations completed, these scripts would be production-worthy.
